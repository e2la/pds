# personal design system

howdy and welcome to my first repo! I don't really know what's going on here lol. 

right now, I'm storing colors from the [Personal Design System](https://www.figma.com/file/ByqrrFoe3vcU3nk8Q5g9Qw/personal-design-system-(21-12-10)?node-id=0%3A1) as CSS variables so I can reference them in my various theming projects :))
